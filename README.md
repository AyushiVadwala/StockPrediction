# StockPrediction

Problem Formulation :
Time series forecasting is an important area of AI. It is important because there are so many prediction problems that involve a time 
component. This time component makes time series problems more difficult to handle. In this project, we have practiced with time 
series data to predict stock price. Predict [Close] of a day based on the last 7 daysâ€™ data [Open, High, Low, Volume, Close] using 
different model.


Models used to predict Stock Price :
Fully-Connected Neural Networks
Long short-term memory (LSTM)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
